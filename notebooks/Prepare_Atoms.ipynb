        "# Making an LLM Think Like Marcus Aurelius\n",
        "\n",
        "## What We're Trying to Do\n",
        "\n",
        "I'm aiming to train an LLM to think and behave like Marcus Aurelius. The plan is to use a decently smart base model (like mistral 7b v3) and fine-tune it on synthetic data we'll generate from his diary, \"Meditations\".\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why This Approach?\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Meditations\" is about 40k tokens long. I've tried training on raw chunks of the text, and while it does boost the model's knowledge about Marcus Aurelius, it's not enough. We need to dig deeper - focusing on facts, behavior, ethics, and thinking patterns. Even for simple facts, we need to hammer them in by training on various tasks based on single or combined facts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Just breaking the text into paragraphs or smaller chunks doesn't cut it. You often end up with bits that aren't self-contained because they reference earlier parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, I'm thinking of rewriting the whole thing into a series of bullet points - each one self-contained and independent as much as possible. This way, we can work with individual points or combine them to generate more synthetic data and tasks (like ethics scenarios, belief systems, factual Q&As, case studies, dialogues, and so on).\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Process\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Prepping the Text**\n",
        "   - Grab the raw XHTML of \"Meditations\".\n",
        "   - Pull out the main text, keeping the structure (books, paragraphs).\n",
        "   - Chop long paragraphs into smaller bits (max 1500 characters).\n",
        "   - Mix in the endnotes with the main text for context.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Extracting \"Atoms\"**\n",
        "   - For each chunk:\n",
        "     a. Spot the subjects, topics, entities, and any specialized terms.\n",
        "     b. Define any fancy terminology.\n",
        "     c. Create \"atoms\" - self-contained bits of info on a single topic.\n",
        "   - Use a beefy LLM (like GPT-4) for this, with a carefully crafted prompt.\n",
        "   - Store these atoms as raw text.\n",
        "   - Why raw text? Well, theoretically, we could get structured JSON right away from powerful LLMs. But I've found that focusing on one specific task at a time helps the LLM do a better job. So we're keeping it simple here - just raw text extraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Structuring the Atoms**\n",
        "   - Now we take that raw atom text and turn it into structured data.\n",
        "   - For this step, we use a less powerful but still decent model (like GPT-3.5-turbo).\n",
        "   - The idea is that by breaking the process into two steps, we get better quality output. The first LLM focuses solely performing the main task (extracting good atoms), and the second one just has to worry about structuring what's already there.\n",
        "   - We use a Pydantic model to keep the data structure consistent:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     class Atom(BaseModel):\n",
        "         subject: str\n",
        "         topic: str\n",
        "         entities: list[str]\n",
        "         text: str\n",
        "\n",
        "     class SpecializedTerminology(BaseModel):\n",
        "         term: str\n",
        "         definition: str\n",
        "\n",
        "     class Atoms(BaseModel):\n",
        "         atoms: list[Atom]\n",
        "         specialized_terminologies: list[SpecializedTerminology]\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - We use the Instructor library with our LLM to pull this structured data from the raw text.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Storing the Data**\n",
        "   - Use JSONL format to store processed data. It's simple and easy to append to or read from.\n",
        "   - Write functions to add new data and load existing stuff.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Iterative Processing**\n",
        "   - Process chunks one after another, using previously processed chunks as examples for consistency.\n",
        "   - Here's the special sauce: We use a rolling window of the last N chunks plus the chapter/book summary in the prompt. This way, we don't lose context even when processing later parts of the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Some Notes on Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "- We're using Google Colab, which has a habit of shutting down. To avoid losing progress, we're storing in-progress data on Google Drive.\n",
        "- We're using JSONL as it's dead simple. Later, we'll convert this into a proper dataset and upload it to Hugging Face.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach should give us a rich, structured dataset from \"Meditations\" that really captures Marcus Aurelius' philosophy and thought processes. We can then use these atoms to create all sorts of training tasks for our LLM, aiming to make it think and respond like the old Roman emperor himself."

This integrated summary combines specific lessons from individuals with overarching themes, offering a comprehensive view of his Stoic philosophy and personal development.''',\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Book 2\n",
        "    '''\\\n",
        "In Book II of \"Meditations,\" Marcus Aurelius delves into the practice of Stoic philosophy, emphasizing self-reflection, rationality, and acceptance of nature's order.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Self-Reflection and Inner Life\n",
        "Marcus begins his day by preparing himself to encounter various negative human behaviors such as arrogance, deceit, and envy. He acknowledges that these traits stem from ignorance of good and evil. By recognizing that all humans share the same divine intelligence, he resolves not to be harmed or angered by others. Instead, he focuses on the importance of internal harmony and the ruling part of his soul, rejecting physical distractions and embracing the transience of life.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Human Nature and Cooperation\n",
        "Marcus emphasizes the inherent kinship among all humans, advocating for natural cooperation rather than conflict. He draws analogies to body parts working together, suggesting that acting against one another is contrary to nature. This understanding guides him to maintain patience and compassion, viewing others' wrongdoings as results of their ignorance.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### The Divine and Providence\n",
        "He reflects on the role of Providence, seeing all events as interconnected and part of a greater natural order. Marcus stresses that what happens is for the advantage of the whole universe, including himself. Accepting fate with gratitude, he discards the pursuit of trivial knowledge, focusing instead on living a life aligned with nature and divine will.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Philosophical Principles\n",
        "Central to Marcus' reflections is the Stoic distinction between good and evil, based on reason and virtue. He commits to living each moment with dignity, affection, freedom, and justice. This involves rejecting hypocrisy, self-love, and discontent, and embracing simplicity and sincerity in his actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Mortality and Life’s Impermanence\n",
        "Marcus contemplates the inevitability of death and the transient nature of life, reminding himself that all things, including fame and pleasure, are fleeting and insignificant. He views death as a natural process and encourages accepting it without fear. This perspective helps him focus on the present and live in accordance with his philosophical principles.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Practical Ethics and Daily Conduct\n",
        "He advises living each day as if it were the last, performing every action with purpose and without carelessness. By doing so, Marcus aims to achieve a life of tranquility and fulfillment, akin to the existence of the gods, who require nothing more from him than adherence to these few principles.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Mental Discipline and Focus\n",
        "Marcus underscores the importance of mental discipline, avoiding distractions and aimless pursuits. He stresses observing and understanding one's own mind, maintaining the inner daemon (rational self) pure from passions, thoughtlessness, and dissatisfaction. This inner focus ensures that his actions are deliberate and aligned with reason.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Philosophical Insights from Others\n",
        "He references Theophrastus, who argued that offenses driven by desire are more blameworthy than those driven by anger, due to the lack of rational control in the former. Marcus reflects on this insight, recognizing the importance of self-control and rationality in moral conduct. He also acknowledges the influence of Cynic Monimus on the notion that all is opinion, highlighting the subjective nature of human perceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Natural Order and Acceptance\n",
        "Marcus reiterates the necessity of aligning with the natural order, accepting events as they occur. He views the universe as a rational entity that does not err in its administration, and he sees no reason to fear change or dissolution, as these are natural and inevitable processes. By accepting his place within the greater whole, Marcus finds peace and purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Overall Themes\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Stoic Philosophy**: Emphasizing rationality, virtue, and acceptance of nature’s course.\n",
        "2. **Human Interactions**: Understanding and compassion towards others, recognizing shared humanity and natural cooperation.\n",
        "3. **Mortality and Impermanence**: Contemplation of death and the transient nature of life to maintain perspective.\n",
        "4. **Providence and Divine Order**: Trust in the universe's rational order and the providence of the gods.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Human Mortality and Impermanence\n",
        "Marcus reflects on the inevitability of death and the constant wasting away of life. He stresses the urgency of living wisely, as mental faculties may decline with age, making it harder to comprehend and act according to reason. This reflection underlines the necessity of disciplined reason for living a purposeful life and highlights the transient nature of human existence.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Natural Beauty and Acceptance\n",
        "Marcus finds beauty in natural processes and imperfections. He describes the attractiveness in the splitting of baked bread, the ripeness of fruits, and the aging of humans. By observing these natural occurrences, he emphasizes accepting and finding pleasure in the inherent value of all stages and forms of life. This appreciation of natural beauty aligns with the Stoic acceptance of the universe's order.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Historical Perspective\n",
        "Reflecting on historical figures like Hippocrates, Alexander, Pompeius, Caesar, Heraclitus, Democritus, and Socrates, Marcus underscores the certainty of death for all, regardless of their achievements. This historical perspective reminds him that life is fleeting and that human accomplishments, no matter how grand, are ultimately transient.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Purposeful Living\n",
        "Marcus advocates for living with purpose and clarity, avoiding thoughts and actions that do not contribute to the common good. He emphasizes the importance of maintaining a benevolent and socially fitting mindset, ensuring that one's actions and thoughts are clear, honest, and purposeful. This focus on purposeful living is essential for achieving a life of tranquility and fulfillment.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Virtue and Rationality\n",
        "Central to Marcus' reflections is the importance of virtues such as justice, truth, temperance, and fortitude. He finds self-satisfaction through right reason and acceptance of his condition. By keeping the inner deity (rational mind) pure and free from distractions, he maintains a life aligned with Stoic principles, prioritizing rationality and virtue over external validations.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Role of the Inner Deity\n",
        "Marcus reveres the faculty that produces opinions, maintaining freedom from hasty judgments and practicing obedience to the gods. He emphasizes preserving the rational mind (inner deity) uncorrupted and free from passions, thoughtlessness, and dissatisfaction. This inner focus ensures that his actions are deliberate and aligned with reason.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Simplicity and Contentment\n",
        "Marcus embraces simplicity, avoiding complexity and excessive attachment to external validations. He focuses on what is within his control, finding contentment in the present moment. By rejecting distractions and maintaining a simple life, he aligns his actions with his philosophical principles and finds inner peace.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Philosophical Preparedness\n",
        "Marcus emphasizes the importance of being prepared with principles for understanding divine and human matters. He maintains a reference to the bond between the divine and human in every action, ensuring that his actions are consistent with higher values. This philosophical readiness helps him navigate life's challenges with clarity and purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Living According to Nature\n",
        "Aligning actions with natural law and rationality is a key theme in Marcus' reflections. He advocates treating others with benevolence and justice based on natural kinship and accepting fate and the natural course of events without resentment. This acceptance of nature's order is central to Stoic philosophy and guides his actions and thoughts.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Mind-Body Distinction\n",
        "Marcus distinguishes between the body (sensations), soul (appetites), and intelligence (principles). He focuses on what is unique to the good man: contentment with fate and maintaining internal tranquility. By keeping the rational mind pure and uncorrupted, he upholds the core Stoic belief in living a life governed by reason and virtue.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Broader Themes\n",
